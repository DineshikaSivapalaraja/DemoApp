**MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern**

**Model** (User.java): The User class represents the data model. It is annotated with @Entity, suggesting that it is a JPA entity, and it is used to map data to a database table.

**Controller** (MainController.java): The MainController class serves as the controller in the MVC pattern. 
It handles incoming HTTP requests, processes them (often by interacting with the model), and returns the appropriate response. 
It contains methods annotated with @GetMapping and @PostMapping to handle GET and POST requests, respectively.

**Repository** (UserRepository.java): The UserRepository interface acts as a repository or data access object (DAO) in the MVC pattern. It extends CrudRepository, providing basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for the User entity. 
Spring Data JPA will automatically implement these methods at runtime.

In the MVC pattern, the "View" is typically represented by the presentation layer, which could include HTML templates, Thymeleaf templates, or other view technologies. 
In this provided code, I am building a RESTful API, and the response data (representation) is usually in JSON format. In this case, the view is implicit in the data returned by controller methods, 
and there's no separate view component.

So, while I have the Model (User), the Controller (MainController), and the Repository (UserRepository), the "View" aspect is more implicit in the data returned by controller methods, 
which is often in JSON format for RESTful APIs.
